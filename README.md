Welcome to the United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short! The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. 
The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. Their hope is that being able to visualize their data will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding..) on issues facing our planet.

### Level 1: Basic Visualization

* USGS earthquake data was used for the project
* A map was created using Leaflet plotting all of the earthquakes data based on their longitude and latitude.
* Markers reflects the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. 
  Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appears larger and darker in color.
* Popups provides additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.
* Legend was created providing context for the map
